문제
In a box shaped like an 
N
×
N
 grid, a snail is crawling. 
If the edge of the box is in front of the snail, it turns 
90
 degrees to the right in place. Otherwise, it moves straight one space. 
This snail does not revisit the grids it has been to in the past. 
Also, if there is no longer a space for the snail to proceed, the snail goes into hibernation.
The example below is for when 
N
=
3
.


1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5

After the snail goes into hibernation, write a program that outputs the order in which the snail visited each grid.
The snail starts crawling from the top left corner of the grid.


입력
On the first line, the integer 
N
 is given.
(
1
≤
N
≤
100
)


출력
For every grid, output over 
N
 lines, indicating the order in which the snail visited each grid, separated by spaces.
