문제
In a box shaped like an 
N
×
N
 grid, a snail is crawling. 
If a wall or the edge of the box is in front of the snail, it turns 
90
 degrees to the right in place. Otherwise, it moves straight one space. 
This snail does not revisit the grids it has been to in the past. 
Also, if there is no longer a space for the snail to proceed, the snail goes into hibernation. 


The example below is for when 
N
=
3
 and the box's information is as follows.


0 0 0
-1 0 0
0 0 0

After the snail goes into hibernation, write a program that outputs the order in which the snail visited each grid.
The snail starts crawling from the top left corner of the grid.
Let's assume the top left corner is an empty space.


입력
On the first line, the integer 
N
 is given.
(
1
≤
N
≤
100
)


From the second line to the (
N
+
1
)-th line, 
N
 integers are given.
This represents the information of the box at 
(
x
,
y
)
, where 
0
 indicates an empty space and 
−
1
 indicates a wall.


출력
For every grid, output over 
N
 lines, indicating the order in which the snail visited each grid, separated by spaces.
Print 
0
 for grids that were not visited.
