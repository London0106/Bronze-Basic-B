문제
Lena starts at the 2D coordinate system at 
(
0
,
0
)
 and wants to move 
N
 times. 


When his current position is 
(
x
,
y
)
, Lena moves according to the following commands:



W : Moves to 
(
x
,
y
+
1

1
)

D : Moves to 
(
x

Write a program that determines the coordinate 
(
x

 where Lena stands after moving 
N
 times.
