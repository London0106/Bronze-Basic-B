A string is an array of characters, so we can access a specific character just like accessing the value of an array.


For example, if s1 is "helloalgo," we can access the 'a' at the sixth position using s1[5].


Given a string and a position, let's try to output the character at that position!


입력
A string without any spaces is given on the first line.
An integer representing the position is given on the second line. The inputted number is smaller than the length of the string.


출력
Output the character at the specified position.
