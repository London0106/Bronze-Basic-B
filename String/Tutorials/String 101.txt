Long, long ago, when we first learned programming, we practiced inputting and outputting single numbers or characters.


This time, let's practice inputting and outputting strings!


To input a string, the following steps are required:


Include the header: #include <iostream>

Use the namespace: using namespace std;


All three steps must be taken in order to properly use strings.


To declare a string, use the following format: "string variable_name;". For example, to declare a string called s1, you can write "string s1;".


When using iostream to input a string, use the format "cin >> variable_name". And when outputting, use the format "cout << variable_name". If you want to start a new line (similar to "\n" in cstdio), you can use "endl".


Now, let's practice inputting and outputting strings using the template code!


입력
A string without any spaces is given on a single line.


출력
Output the inputted string as it is.
