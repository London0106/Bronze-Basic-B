You went to a delicious ramen restaurant.
In this restaurant, you can add as many eggs as you want to your ramen.
The basic price of the ramen is 7000 won, and each additional egg costs an extra 1000 won.
You want to have eggs, but you feel like it would be too expensive to just add them blindly!
You want to think about whether to have eggs or not within five decisions.
Let's say "o" represents the decision to add an egg, and "x" represents the decision not to add an egg.
Given a decision string with a length of at most 5, let's calculate the ramen price that needs to be paid.


입력
