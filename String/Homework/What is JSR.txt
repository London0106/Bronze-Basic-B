While reading her friends' notes, Lily came across the word "JSR Club" and became curious about what "JSR" means.
Pondering over the meaning of "JSR," Lily discovered that it is an abbreviation of the names of the three musketeers: James, Sirius, and Remus.
In this way, when three names are given separated by spaces, let's output the club name by concatenating only the first letters of each name.
