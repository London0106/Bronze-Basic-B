Santa John and the polar bear Willy fight with each other every day but believe that they are friends.
However, their trust is sometimes broken when they play games.


To rebuild their unity, John and Willy want to play a new game.


The game is very simple: they take turns saying one letter each to form a desired string. For example, to say the string 'helloalgo,' Willy would say 'hlolo' and John would say 'elag'!


If we are given the words that Willy and John said, we need to create a program to determine the original word they intended to say.
For example, if 'hlolo' and 'elag' are given as input, the program should output 'helloalgo'!


입력
The first line contains the word that Willy said, and the second line contains the word that John said.
The length of the two words is either the same or the word that Willy said is one character longer.
Note that all words are shorter than 1000 characters.


출력
Output the word that Willy and John intended to say together.
