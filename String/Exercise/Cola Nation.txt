문제
A few days ago, the polar bear Willy, who purchased a smartphone, downloaded a cola delivery application called "Cola Nation"! Impressed by the ability to have cola delivered, Willy immediately wanted to make a call to order cola.


However, since Willy has never made a phone call before, he cannot determine if the phone number provided in the "Cola Nation" application is a valid phone number or an incorrect one. 


Being suspicious, Willy became curious about whether the phone number displayed in the application is a valid phone number or not. He asked you to confirm!


In the Arctic, phone numbers should have the format of (digits)-(digits), and there should be A digits before the hyphen and B digits after the hyphen.


For example, if A is 3 and B is 2, a phone number like 284-38 is correct, but numbers like 855-393 or 37-484 are incorrect.


Let's create a program that tells Willy if the phone number he saw in the application is a valid phone number!


입력
The first line contains two integers A and B, representing the format of the Arctic's phone number. (Note that both A and B are between 1 and 5.)
The second line contains the phone number that Willy saw in the "Cola Nation" application.


출력
If the phone number Willy saw corresponds to a valid phone number, output "Yes". Otherwise, output "No".
