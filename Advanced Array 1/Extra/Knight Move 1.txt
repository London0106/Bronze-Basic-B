문제
There are 
N
 white knights placed on an 
8
×
8
 chessboard. 
The coordinates on the chessboard are represented by 
(
x
,
y
)
, where 
x
=
1
,
2
,
.
.
.
,
8
 is replaced with 
a
,
b
,
.
.
.
,
h
 and 
y
 is represented by 
1
 to 
8
. 


The knight can move as shown in the diagram below, and it cannot move outside the boundaries of the chessboard. Additionally, the knight cannot move to a square occupied by another white piece.



The two diagrams below are examples of two white knights positioned at 
(
3
,
4
)
 and 
(
6
,
5
)
 on the chessboard.
The knight at 
(
3
,
4
)
 can capture a black piece located at 
(
2
,
6
)
, 
(
1
,
5
)
, or 
(
2
,
2
)
 with just one move.

입력
The information of the chessboard is provided from the first line to the eighth line, separated by spaces.


the 
j
-th value in the 
i
-th line corresponds to the information of the square 
(
j
,
9
−
i
)
 on the chessboard.


If the square 
(
j
,
9
−
i
)
 is represented as '.', it indicates an empty square.
If it is represented as 'B', it means there is a black piece on that square.
If it is represented as 'W', it means there is a white piece other than a knight on that square.
If it is represented as 'K', it means there is a white knight on that square.


출력
Let's call the number of pieces each knight can capture in a single move as 
A
1
,
A
2
, ..., 
A
N
.
Output the frequency of occurrences of 
0
, 
1
, ..., 
8
 in 
A
, separated by spaces.
