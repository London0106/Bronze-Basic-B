In Haru's modified chess variant, there are 
N
 black rooks placed on an 
8
×
8
 chessboard. 
The coordinates on the chessboard are represented by 
(
x
,
y
)
, where 
x
=
1
,
2
,
.
.
.
,
8
 is replaced with 
a
,
b
,
.
.
.
,
h
 and 
y
 is represented by 
1
 to 
8
. 


Unlike regular chess, in this variant, the rook can move like a knight, as shown in the arrows below. 
The rook can jump over other pieces and cannot move to a square occupied by another black piece. Additionally, the rook cannot move beyond the edges of the chessboard.



The two pictures below are examples of two black rooks located at 
(
5
,
8
)
 and 
(
6
,
6
)
 respectively. 
The rook at 
(
5
,
8
)
 can make a single move to capture the white pieces at 
(
5
,
3
)
 and 
(
5
,
2
)
.



The rook at 
(
6
,
6
)
 can make a single move to capture the white piece at 
(
6
,
2
)
.

입력
The information of the chessboard is provided from the first line to the eighth line, separated by spaces.


the 
j
-th value in the 
i
-th line corresponds to the information of the square 
(
j
,
9
−
i
)
 on the chessboard.


If the square 
(
j
,
9
−
i
)
 is represented as '.', it indicates an empty square.
If it is represented as 'B', it means there is a black piece other than a rook on that square.
If it is represented as 'W', it means there is a white piece on that square.
If it is represented as 'R', it means there is a black rook on that square.


출력
Let's call the number of pieces each rook can capture in a single move as 
A
1
,
A
2
, ..., 
A
N
.
Output the number of cases 
0
, 
1
, ..., 
14
 in 
A
, separated by spaces.


For example, only one Black Rook is on the board and that can capture only one white piece, you may output like below;
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
