문제
Haru is driving a car that consumes 1 liter of fuel per minute. 
Haru wants to travel from the starting point to the destination, which takes N minutes.
Initially, the car has M liters of fuel. 
Excluding the destination and gas stations, if the car's remaining fuel becomes 0, Haru can no longer drive the car.

Along the highway, there are K gas stations in order from the starting point. 
The i-th gas station is located Di minutes away from the starting point and can refuel the car with Fi liters of fuel.

Haru must always stop by a gas station on the highway to refuel.
Can Haru reach the destination with the available fuel?

(Subtask 1) (10 pts) 1≤K≤3.
(Subtask 2) (90 pts) There are no additional constraints or conditions.

입력
The first line consists of three integers N, M, and K separated by spaces.
(10≤N,M≤1,000, 1≤K≤10)

From the second line to the (K+1)-th line, each line contains the information of the i-th gas station, Di and Fi, separated by spaces.
Di is given without duplicates and in ascending order.
(1≤Di<N, 1≤Fi≤100)

출력
If Haru can reach the destination, output 1;
otherwise, output 0.
