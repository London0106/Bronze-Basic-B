문제
You are given a special sequence that repeats the numbers from 1 to N.
For odd numbers, each value is repeated twice, and for even numbers, each value is repeated four times. 

The following is a partial representation of this sequence:
1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, ...

Given the value of N and the position M, write a program to find and output the M-th value in the sequence. Assume that the first value at the beginning of the sequence is considered the 1st value.

입력
The first line consists of two integers N and M separated by a space.
(1≤N≤1000, 1≤M≤2×[(3N)/(2)])


출력
Print the M-th value in the sequence.
