문제
Let's define R(X) as a function that reverses all the digits of X. 
Write a program to print R(R(X)×R(Y)). 
If there are leading zeros in the result, remove them before outputting the final answer.

(Subtask 1) (10 pts) 1≤X,Y≤9.
(Subtask 2) (90 pts) There are no additional constraints or conditions.

입력
The first line consists of two integers X and Y separated by a space.
(1≤X,Y≤10,000)

출력
