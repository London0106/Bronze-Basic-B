문제
Let's create an easily made calculator. 
Given an equation consisting of n integers and n−1 operators, but only plus and minus, calculate the result by performing the operations from left to right, regardless of the operator precedence. 
It is guaranteed that all of the numbers appears in the solving process are within int range.
(during calculations, any decimal points resulting from division are truncated).

입력
The first line of input contains an integer n, the number of integers.
(n is an integer less than 20)
The second line contains the equation consisting of n integers and n−1 operators.
(All integers are less than 100.)
Only plus and minus appear as operators.

출력
Print the result of the equation calculated from left to right.
