문제
In a mine, a very large stone containing 
N
 (
1
≤
N
≤
9
) types of ores has been excavated, and a special machine is required to extract these ores from the stone. This special machine operates in the following manner:
Starting from the left and moving in sequence, adjacent ores of the same type can be extracted all at once.
For instance, if 
N
=
2
 and the sequence of ores is 
11122211
, it would take 
3
 seconds.


Write a program to determine the minimum time needed to extract all the ores from this very large stone.
