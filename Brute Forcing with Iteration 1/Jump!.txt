문제
In Haru's jumping game:




Haru starts at position 
0
.

Haru randomly selects one integer from the 
N
 integers in array 
A
 and jumps forward by that number of positions.
For example, if 
A
=
[
5
,
7
]
, and Haru is at position 
0
, selecting 
5
 would make Haru jump to position 
5
. Haru can pick the same integer multiple times.

Haru cannot jump backward.



Given an integer 
K
, if Haru can strategically draw cards to reach position 
K
, print 
1
; otherwise, print 
0
.


입력
The first line contains two integers 
N
 and 
K
 separated by a space.
(
1
≤
N
≤
10
, 
1
≤
K
≤
10
,
000
)


The second line consists of 
N
 integers separated by spaces. These integers represent the elements of array 
A
, and the given numbers are all distinct.
(
1
≤
A
i
≤
50
)


출력
If Haru can strategically draw cards to reach position 
K
, print 
1
; otherwise, print 
0
.
