문제
There are 
N
 white knights placed on an 
8
×
8
 chessboard. 
The coordinates on the chessboard are represented by 
(
x
,
y
)
, where 
x
=
1
,
2
,
.
.
.
,
8
 is replaced with 
a
,
b
,
.
.
.
,
h
 and 
y
 is represented by 
1
 to 
8
. 


Considering all squares on the chessboard, for each square, output the number of white knights that can arrive in that square after moving only once. 


The knight can move as shown in the diagram below, and it cannot move outside the boundaries of the chessboard. Additionally, the knight cannot move to a square occupied by another white piece.



The two diagrams below are examples of two white knights positioned at 
(
3
,
4
)
 and 
(
6
,
5
)
 on the chessboard.
The knight located at 
(
3
,
4
)
 can move in a single step to 
(
2
,
6
)
, 
(
1

. 
It cannot move to 
(
8
,
6
)
 or 
(
7
,
7
)
 as there are white pieces on these squares.

입력
The information of the chessboard is provided from the first line to the eighth line, separated by spaces.


the 
j
-th value in the 
i
-th line corresponds to the information of the square 
(
j
,
9
−
i
)
 on the chessboard.


If the square 
(
j
,
9
−
i
)
 is represented as '.', it indicates an empty square.
If it is represented as 'B', it means there is a black piece on that square.
If it is represented as 'W', it means there is a white piece other than a knight on that square.
If it is represented as 'K', it means there is a white knight on that square.


출력
Considering all squares on the chessboard, for each square, print the number of white knights that can arrive in that square after moving only once. 
Provide the results in 
8
 lines, separated by spaces.
