문제
There are 
N
 speed cameras on the highway. There is only one camera at each location.
In 
M
 sections, Haru was speeding, and if each section has one or more speed cameras, Haru must pay a fine of 
K
 won multiplied by the number of cameras. 
Speeding sections can overlap with each other.


Write a program to calculate the total amount of fine that Haru has to pay.
Even if speed cameras are present at the starting and ending points of the speeding sections, they will still be enforced.


입력
The first line consists of three integers 
N
, 
M
, and 
K
 separated by spaces.

The second line contains 
N
 integers separated by spaces. 
These represent the coordinates of the speed cameras.


From the third to the (
M
+
2
)-th line, each line contains two integers 
X
 and 
Y
 separated by spaces. 
These represent the starting and ending points of each speeding section, respectively.
