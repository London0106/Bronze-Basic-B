문제
Lena put up two posters on the bulletin board to find members for her guild. 
Haru also placed one poster on top to promote his guild. 
When attaching the posters, if the newly placed poster partially overlaps with the existing ones, the previously placed poster becomes partially hidden.


Write a program to calculate the visible area of Lena's two posters after Haru has placed his poster on top.
