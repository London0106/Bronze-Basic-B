문제
Haru wants to promote a parking lot by putting up 
N
 posters with consecutive numbers from 
1
 to 
N
 on the wall of the parking lot. 
However, if a poster overlaps with a previously attached one, the part of the previous poster behind the new one becomes hidden.


Write a program to calculate the area visible when all 
N
 posters are attached to the parking lot wall. 
The program should output the total area visible with posters numbered from 
1
 to 
N
.


입력
The first line contains an integer 
N
.
(
3
≤
N
≤
1
,
000
)


From the second line to the (
N
+
1
)-th line, there are integers 
x

, 
y
1

y
2
 given, separated by spaces.

)
 represents the top-right coordinates of the poster.


출력

N
 posters, output the area where posters from 
1
 to 
N
 are visible on the parking lot wall, separated by spaces.
