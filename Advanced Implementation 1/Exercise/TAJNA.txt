Every evening, little Ivica sends secret messages to little Marica through e-mail. Knowing Ivica's e-letter travels unguarded through the network on its way to Marica's e-mailbox, they have decided to encrypt every message using the following algorithm:


• Suppose Ivica's message consists of N characters.
• Ivica must first find a matrix consisting of R rows and C columns such that R ≤ C and R·C = N. If there is more than one such matrix, Ivica chooses the one with the most rows.
• Ivica writes his message into the matrix in row-major order. In other words, he writes the first segment of the message into the first row, the second segment into the second row and so on.
• The message he sends to Marica is the matrix read in column-major order.


Marica has grown tired of spending her precious time deciphering Ivica's messages, so you must write a program to do it for her.
