문제
Haru has a very old rotary telephone.

If Haru wants to make a call, they need to rotate the dial to the corresponding number for each letter in the name of the person they want to call.
The time it takes to move to a character on the dial is the same as the numerical value found on that character. For example, it takes 
2
 seconds to move to A.
Additionally, after dialing each digit, the rotary dial returns to its initial position, and to dial the next number, the dial must be rotated from the starting position again.


To call Lena, Haru simply needs to dial the numbers corresponding to each letter in her name LENA. For instance, LENA corresponds to the numbers 5362.


Write a program to calculate the time required for Haru to make a call to the person whose name is given.
