문제
Haru is cleaning the room. In front of Haru, there are N piles of dust in sequence, and each pile has a weight of Wi. 
Haru starts cleaning from the first dust pile and can stop in the middle of the process, in which case Haru cannot clean the remaining dust piles.


Haru wants to clean as many dust piles as possible while keeping the total weight of the cleaned piles as close to K as possible. 
In this case, what is the maximum number of dust piles that Haru can clean?


입력
The first line consists of two integers N and K separated by a space.
(1≤N≤1,000, 1≤K≤1,000,000)

The second line consists of N integers separated by spaces. 
Wi represents the weight of the i-th dust pile.
The weight of the dust at the beginning is less than or equal to 2×K.
(1≤Wi≤1,000)


출력
Print the maximum number of dust piles that Haru can clean.
