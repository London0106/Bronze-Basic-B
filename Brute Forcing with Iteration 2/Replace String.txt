문제
Approximately 100 years later, the string left by Haru was discovered, corroded and transformed. 
Scholars began to look for data to decode the string left by Haru, and finally found out that the 
S
 in the original string was transformed into 
T
 due to corrosion. 


Given 
S
, 
T
, and the transformed string, 
R
, find the original string left by Haru.
T
 appears only once in 
R
.
