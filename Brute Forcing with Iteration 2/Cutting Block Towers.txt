문제
There are 
N
 tower blocks, each stacked with 
A
i
 blocks of height 
1
. 
When cutting off the top part of all these tower blocks at heights 
h
=
1
, 
h
=
2
, …, 
h
=
B
, determine the number of blocks removed at each height 
h
.


For the example below, given 
A
i
=
 [
6
, 
5
, 
9
, 
2
] and when 
h
=
1
,
the number of blocks cut off is 
5
+
4
+
8
+
1
=
18
.





입력
On the first line, integers 
N
 and 
B
 are provided, separated by a space.
(

1
≤
i
≤
N
, 
1
≤
A
i
≤
1
,
000
)


출력
For each 
h
=
1
, 
h
=
2
, ..., 
h
=
B
, print the number of blocks being cut off, one per line.
