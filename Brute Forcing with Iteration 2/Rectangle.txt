문제
Write a program that calculates the sum of the numbers at the four corners of any rectangle that can be formed in an 
N
×
M
 size array, each element of which contains one of the numbers from 
0
 to 
9
. 


Let's say the numbers at each corner are 
i
, 
j
, 
k
, 
m
. The program should compute the 
∑
(
i
×
j
×
k
×
m
)
.
The positions of the four corners must be different from each other.


입력
The first line will contain the integers 
N
 and 
M
, separated by a space.
(
2
≤
N
,
M
≤
50
)


From the second line to the (
N
+
1
)-th line, 
M
 integers are provided, separated by a space.
