Write a program that outputs 
1
 if a given string 
S
 can be composed only using the Helloalgo Language, which consists of 
N
 words, and 
0
 if it cannot.


There are no cases where for 
i
≠
j
, 
A
i
 is a substring of 
A
j
, or 
A
j
 is a substring of 
A
i
. 
For example, there are no cases where 
A
i
=
 wow, 
A
j
=
 wowow.
