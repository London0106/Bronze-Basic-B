문제
In a square garden with a grid shape of length 
N
 both horizontally and vertically, we want to mow the grass. 
Q
 queries are given. The information of the queries is as follows:



L 
a
 
b
: Mow all the grass in the grids on 
x
=
1
, 
2
, …, 
a
 / 
y
=
b
.
R 
a
 
b
: Mow all the grass in the grids on 
x
=
a
, 
a
+
1
, …, 
N
 / 
y
=
b
.
U 
a
 
b
: Mow all the grass in the grids on 
x
=
a
 / 
y
=
b
, 
b
−
1
, …, 
1
.
D 
a
 
b
: Mow all the grass in the grids on 
x
=
a
 / 
y
=
b
, 
b
+
1
, …, 
N
.



If the grass in the grid to be mowed is already cut, it is not mowed again.
Initially, the grass in the garden is all grown. The top-left coordinate of the garden is 
(
1
,
1
)
, the top-right coordinate is 
(
N
,
1
)
, and the bottom-right coordinate is 
(
N
,
N
)
.


Write a program that calculates the area of the mowed grass.


입력
On the first line, integers 
N
 and 
Q
 are given, separated by a space.
(
1
≤
N
≤
1
,
000
, 
1
≤
Q
≤
500
)


From the second line, the information for the 
Q
 queries is given, one per line, separated by a space.
(
1
≤
a
,
b
≤
N
)


출력
