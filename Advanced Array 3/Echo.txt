문제
At the point 
x
=
A
i
 on the mountain ridge, the decibel level of the echo is amplified by a factor of 
2
.
If the current position of the echo is not on the mountain ridge(excluding 
x
=
0
), the decibel level decreases by 
1
.
The decibel level does not decrease below 
0
.


This mountain has a peculiar feature, allowing you to select a single mountain ridge where the decibel level of the echo can be amplified by a factor of 
4
.
An echo with a decibel level of 
D
 is generated in the direction 
x
>
0
 from 
x
=
0
. Determine the maximum decibel level of the echo at point 
x
=
B
.


입력
On the first line, the number of mountain ridges 
N
, 
B
 and 
D
 are given, separated by a space.
(
1
≤
N
≤
30
, 
N

B
, 
i
≠
j
⇒
A
i
≠
A
j
)
