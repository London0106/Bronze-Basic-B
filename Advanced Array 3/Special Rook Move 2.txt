In Haru's modified chess variant, there are 
N
 black rooks placed on an 
8
×
8
 chessboard. 
The coordinates on the chessboard are represented by 
(
x
,
y
)
, where 
x
=
1
,
2
,
.
.
.
,
8
 is replaced with 
a
,
b
,
.
.
.
,
h
 and 
y
 is represented by 
1
 to 
8
. 


For every square on the chessboard, considering all black rooks moving once, output the number of rooks that can reach each square.


Unlike regular chess, in this variant, the rook can move like a knight, as shown in the arrows below. 
The rook can jump over other pieces and cannot move to a square occupied by another black piece. Additionally, the rook cannot move beyond the edges of the chessboard.



The two pictures below are examples of two black rooks located at 
(
5
,
8
)
 and 
(
6
,
6
)
 respectively. 
The rook located at 
(
5
,
8
)
 can move to a total of 12 squares by making a single move, reaching the following positions: 
(
1
,
8
)
, ..., 
(
4

입력
The information of the chessboard is provided from the first line to the eighth line, separated by spaces.


the 
j
-th value in the 
i
-th line corresponds to the information of the square 
(
j
,
9
−
i
)
 on the chessboard.


If the square 
(
j
,
9
−
i
)
 is represented as '.', it indicates an empty square.
If it is represented as 'B', it means there is a black piece other than a rook on that square.
If it is represented as 'W', it means there is a white piece on that square.
If it is represented as 'R', it means there is a black rook on that square.


출력
For every square on the chessboard, considering all black rooks moving once, output the number of rooks that can reach each square in 
8
 lines, separated by spaces.
