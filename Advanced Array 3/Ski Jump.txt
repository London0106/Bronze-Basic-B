문제
There is a ski jump slope where, if 
i
>
j
, then 
h
i
>
h
j
 and haru skis and moves from 
x
=
n
 to 
x
=
n
+
1
, one unit at a time.
Haru skis from 
x
=
0
. If there's a jumping platform at his current location, he must jump from it. 
However, since Haru is trying ski jumping for the first time, if he jumps from 
x
=
A
i
, he lands at 
x
=
A
i
+
K
. 


Given the length 
L
 of the ski jump slope, the number of jumping platforms 
J
, and 
K
, determine the number of times Haru jumps until he reaches 
x
=
L
.
Assume that he never jumps past the point 
x
=
L
.


입력
On the first line, integers 
L

J
 integers representing 
A

⇒
A

출력

x
=
L
.
