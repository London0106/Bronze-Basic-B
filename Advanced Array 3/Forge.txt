In the neighborhood where Lena lives, there is a very famous forge that produces swords. 
The forge plans to produce 
N
 swords today, and each sword is crafted by a skilled artisan. 
If the production periods of swords 
i
 and 
j
 overlap, the required number of artisans is 
A
i
+
A
j

100
)


From the second to the (
N
+
1
)-th line, each line consists of three integers 
X
, 
Y
, and 
A
i
 separated by spaces. 
These represent the start time, end time, and the number of artisans required to produce a sword, respectively.
