문제
Lena, who works at Algo’s Kitchen, received an order from the restaurant owner, Haru, to serve steak and grilled fish, one of each, to 
N
 tables within 
M
 minutes. 
However, the oven is malfunctioning. It starts at 
T
1
°C, then after 
(
T
2
−
T
1
)
 minutes, it heats up to 
T
2
°C. It rises by 
1
°C every minute.
After 
1
 minute, it cools down back to 
T
1
°C. This process keeps repeating. 


The steak needs to be cooked at a temperature of 
S
T
°C or higher for at least 
A
 minutes, and the fish needs to be cooked at a temperature of 
F
T
°C or higher for at least 
B
 minutes. Can Lena successfully fulfill all the orders?


If Lena fails to complete the orders, Haru will destroy the dishes Lena has prepared.
